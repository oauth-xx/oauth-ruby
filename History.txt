Fix in plain text signatures to bug found by Andrew Arrow. Who contributed new new unit tests for plain text sigs.

== 0.3.0

* Support ActionController::Request from Edge Rails (László Bácsi)
* Correctly handle multi-valued parameters (Seth)
* Added #normalized_parameters to OAuth::RequestProxy::Base (Pelle)
* OAuth::Signature.sign and friends now yield the RequestProxy instead of the
  token when the passed block's arity is 1. (Seth)
* Token requests are made to the configured URL rather than generating a
  potentially incorrect one.  (Kellan Elliott-McCrea)
* Command-line app for generating signatures. (Seth)
* Improved test-cases and compatibility for encoding issues. (Pelle)

== 0.2.2 2008-2-22 Lets actually support SSL release

It didn't actually use https when required.

== 0.2 2008-1-19 All together now release

This is a big release, where we have merged the efforts of various parties into one common library. This means there are definitely some API changes you should be aware of. They should be minimal but please have a look at the unit tests.

== 0.1.2 2007-12-1

* 2 Includes Pat's fix for getting the realm out.

== 0.1.1 2007-11-26

* 1 First release as a GEM
  * Moved all non rails functions into this GEM from the Rails plugin http://code.google.com/p/oauth-plugin/
