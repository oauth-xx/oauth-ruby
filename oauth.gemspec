You have installed oauth version #{OAuth::Version::VERSION}, congratulations!

Non-commercial support for the 1.x series will end by April, 2025. Please make a plan to upgrade to the next version prior to that date.
The only breaking change will be dropped support for Ruby 2.7 and any other versions which will also have reached EOL by then.

Please see:
• #{spec.homepage}/blob/main/SECURITY.md

Note also that I am, and this project is, in the process of leaving Github.
I wrote about some of the reasons here:
